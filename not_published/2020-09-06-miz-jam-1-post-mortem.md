For the past week I have been working on a game, titled **Bad fire**, as part of a game jam called [Miz Jam 1](https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1). There you had 48 hours of active development time that did, not need to be consecutive, to make a game using an art pack that was provided. My submission is linked below.

To download the game visit the game page by clicking the button below.

I'm planning to publish a *post mortem* in about a week outlining the good, the bad, and what I learnt trying to make a game in a limited amount of time.I'll end by sending a wave of appreciation for everyone checking out the game. Stay tuned for more!
