My name is Edvin and in three bullet points I would describe myself as a
* Space enthusiast
* Space engineering student
* Hobbyist game developer

There is a lot of cool, interesting and fascinating things in this world beside the bad. One thing that gives me much joy is our capacity to learn as humans.

When it comes to our place in the universe I really like this following quote by Carl Sagan:
> We are made of starstuff

To me it it sets things into perspective knowing that we literally are made of matter from once dead stars.
