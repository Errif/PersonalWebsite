This post will outline some updates to the website since the release:
* Added a custom rocket icon from *inipagi* contained in this [iconset](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/seo-flat-6)
    * The icon grows on hover using CSS
* Post preview changes
    * The post preview can now optionally include an image which gets displayed to the right of the text. The image is wrapped by `<a> ... </a>` to be clickable. The image also links to the post.
    * Moved the [Read more] button to a new line
    * Each post can now be tagged with an arbitrary number of tags
        * The tags allow the posts to be related to each other. Viewing one post with the tag "website" will show a section **See also** at the end that shows posts (if there are any) with the same tag that also may be of interest.
* Updated, reordered and expanded the menu bar in the top right corner
    * Blog dropdown button to link to all the posts, and also a page with all the tags that links to the relevant posts
    * Projects dropdown button that links to a separate page that I plan to use as a summary page for the games that I have created. **First game coming soon**
    * Functional contact form page where one can reach out to me
* Custom styling to add some additional color to post metadata and tag badge color

The colouring is highly subject to change as I experiment and learn what works best. On one hand I like the simplicity of keeping  the mostly black and white color scheme, though color can add a lot. I'll have to think about it more. If you have any feedback feel free to try out the new contact form :)

I'll end this post by showing some appreciation for the feature of being able to run a local HUGO server with the simple command `hugo server` (or `hugo server -D` if you want to show posts marked as drafts). It enables you to get immediate changes and rapidly prototype, and also makes it more fun to play with. 

Edvin signing off, but I'll be back soon!
