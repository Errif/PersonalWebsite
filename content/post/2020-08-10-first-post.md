A **big** warm welcome to anyone who is reading this!

This will be the first post of my first proper website. I have been meaning to build my own personal website for quite some time but I never got around to doing it. Now here we finally are after a day of work, so while you're reading this allow me to shortly introduce myself.

#### My name is Edvin and I'm a:
* Space enthusiast
* Space engineering student
* Hobbyist game developer

Space and our place in this universe is something that never stops to fascinate me, and likewise the technology that has been ingrained in our way of living. Both of these have influenced my greatly to pursue the things that I do. Recently I have also ventured into game making in my free time.

#### Why am I creating this website?
I am creating this website to be a central place to share my ideas, experiments and things I find interesting. I also see it as an opportunity to learn a bit about web development but also about writing and the act of expression. Our capacity to learn is astonishing and something I value very highly, a beauty of being human.
>  The more you know the less you know you know and you realize there is always more to learn

Looking forward I plan to write about my game development journey and the games that I am making. There is also much to be said about the other interests I brought up above, so if I feel inspired that might also be something I write about. To end this first post I would just like to give a summary of how this website was built for those interested.

#### Overview of how this website was built
 This website is built using the following softwares and tools:
* [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) - Open-source static site generator that generated the website that is displayed here
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Stores the HUGO project using git version control
* [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Builds, deploys and hosts the website by connecting to the HUGO github repository

All of the above are available to use for free and the only thing I paid for was the custom domain name `www.edvin.space`, which I got at a reasonable price from [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). I'm still in the process of learning about all of this and while it requires some setup I think the result shows how you can create a good looking website at a low cost. 

I will keep playing around with it for some time and see where it leads. Eventually I might do a writeup or tutorial if there is interest, though there are already many good resources available.
