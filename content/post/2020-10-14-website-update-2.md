Long time no see. I have been focusing on my courses that I am taking and not much has happened with the website unfortunately. However, I come with a small website update to allow for the use of $$\KaTeX$$, a math typesetting library for the web. See a few examples of the usage of [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) to display math:

A wild integral:

$$\int_{0}^{2} x^2 dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{2} = \frac{2^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = \frac{8}{3} - 0 = \frac{8}{3}$$

A wild identity matrix:

$$I = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
